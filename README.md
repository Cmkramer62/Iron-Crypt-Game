# Iron-Crypt-Game
C# Scripts for the game "The Iron Crypt".
These scripts comprise the entirety of the working C# programming done for the videogame.
As a result, the files are a wide range of programs, from simple things such as audio control
like playing and pausing audio files to complex scripting like AI navigation, behaviour, and pathfinding control.

I have personally created and edited these scripts since I first started working over a few years ago, however this
is the first time I have uploaded them to GitHub, on 11/13/2023. I will continue to update these files as I continue to
work on this game.
